/**
 * This class implements a Fibonacci heap data structure. Much of the
 * code in this class is based on the algorithms in Chapter 21 of the
 * "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein.
 * The amortized running time of most of these methods is O(1), making
 * it a very fast data structure. Several have an actual running time
 * of O(1). removeMin() and delete() have O(log n) amortized running
 * times because they do the heap consolidation.
 *
 * <p><strong>Note that this implementation is not synchronized.</strong>
 * If multiple threads access a set concurrently, and at least one of the
 * threads modifies the set, it <em>must</em> be synchronized externally.
 * This is typically accomplished by synchronizing on some object that
 * naturally encapsulates the set.</p>
